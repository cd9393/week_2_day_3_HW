Homework Reflection:

We worked on the Snowman problem.  Firstly we drew up a class diagram and thought the problem through:  it seemed fairly obvious there were to be 3 classes, Player, HiddenWord and Game.  We thought through the instance variables and the likely methods for each class and formed an initial plan.  Our original plan was quite vague so when we got into the problem and understood it more then the plan expanded, but in general stuck to the guidelines we’d laid out at the start.  I think all of our functions follow the single responsibility principle (with one exception I suppose).  We used TDD throughout the project and managed to test all of our functions.  A major problem we ran into towards the end was the fact that we didn’t have a way of storing the starred out word containing previously guessed letters, the word would always be starred out except from the the guessed letter at the time.  For example, word is “batman”, we didn’t find a way to input something like, “b**t***”, it would always start as”******”.  This makes me think that a better approach might have been to have 2 arrays of the word, one starred out and the other actual letters of the word.  This way we could update the array as the letters are filled in. The only method that we couldn’t get to pass the test was establishing whether the game was won or lost.
